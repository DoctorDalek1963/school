## Further Maths

This is the Further Maths section, with directories split by topic.

`d1` is Decision Mathematics 1, following the Edexcel book. It contains a directory for notebooks, which I use to experiment with certain algorithms like bin packing, and a directory called `graphs`, which contains a Python library that I developed to experiment with graph representation in code, and the implementation of algorithms on these graphs.

This `fm` directory will also soon have a `pure` directory, where I plan to create tools to model linear transformations in real-time, allowing the user to define matrices and see the effect of the transformations defined by these matrices on the plane, as well as the composition of these transformations by matrix multiplication.
