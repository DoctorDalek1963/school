## Computer Science

This is the Computer Science section, with directories split by term.

`t1` is the directory for stuff I did in Term 1. It contains some challenge solutions written in Python, and some assembly code challenge solutions written in the dedicated [Little Man Computer](http://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) programming language.
