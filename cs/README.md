## Computer Science

This is the Computer Science section, with directories split by term.

`term/` contains a folder for stuff I did in each term, indexed by number.

We've got solutions to challenges written in Python as well as some stuff in the dedicated
[Little Man Computer](http://www.peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/) programming language.

We've also got the `project_euler/` directory, which contains solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
problems.
